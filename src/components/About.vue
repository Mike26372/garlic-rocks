    We are a family from the Central Valley of Northern California
    that loves cooking with fresh, wholesome ingredients.
    Garlic is one of our favorite ingredients
    and for over 15 years we have been using a rock to
    crush garlic and easily remove the papery skin.
    So we decided to share our favorite kitchen tool with you!
